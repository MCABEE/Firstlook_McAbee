                    Video profiles are a new and innovative idea to captivate and find a possible life
                    partner. We believe, either than a still photo, a video can communicate more.
                    Through the profile video you can introduce yourself, or you can dance, sing, talk
                    something to your listeners, or anything you are interested. This will help others to
                    get more attached to you. Although this is not mandatory, adding a video profile will
                    make you stand out among the crowd. You can add a ‘One Minute’ (Length should
                    be Sixty seconds or less) selfie video or professionally captured video. You can even
                    add BGM to the video to make it more attractive. It is also possible to remove the
                    video instantly whenever you want.
